Questions

1. What other tests would you suggest could be written? You do not need to write them out in detail or code them.
> We can do Boundary Values Analysis Testing. 
> We can check Required fields for Example - As Living Expenses field is required, it prompts as Required when clicked on "Work out how much I could borrow button" button

2. If this test was part of a much larger test set, how would you speed it up?
> By using Cucumber tags we can filter out and execute specific tests out of large test suite 
> Risk Based testing

3. Sometimes UI tests can fail unpredictably. For example, the page may not have fully loaded before test automation attempts to click a button on a webpage. How would you improve reliability of these tests?
> We can keep Explicit Wait or Fluent Wait
