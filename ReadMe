Questions

What other tests would you suggest could be written? You do not need to write them out in detail or code them.
We can do Boundary Values Analysis Testing. We can check Required fields for Example - As Living Expenses field is required, it prompts as Required when clicked on "Work out how much I could borrow button" button

If this test was part of a much larger test set, how would you speed it up?
By using Cucumber tags we can filter out and execute specific tests out of large test suite Risk Based testing

Sometimes UI tests can fail unpredictably. For example, the page may not have fully loaded before test automation attempts to click a button on a webpage. How would you improve reliability of these tests?
We can keep Explicit Wait or Fluent Wait
